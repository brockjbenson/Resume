      <h2>Addional Information</h2>
  </div>
        <p1>In high school I was always involved in sports. Sports taught me how to have a work ethic and also how
to be a leader. I was captain of our football team, basketball team, and golf team. My senior year we
made it to the state finals for the first time in school history in football, and I have also won a state
championship for golf. My work ethic allowed me to be an all-state athlete more than 4 times, and
also a senior athlete of the year. I take great pride in being a leader/role model in anything I do as I
know the importance of having that voice of guidance and encouragement throughout those years of
    growth.</p1>
  
          <p2>I am a very friendly and outgoing person. It is very easy for me to get along with just about anyone and
not many things affect me in a negative way. I believe that it is due to my communication skills that I
have sharpened from the years of sports, work, and socializing. 
I would say my biggest strengths would be my ability to communicate, building relationships with
others and being able to follow instructions and guidelines very well. My biggest weakness would be
my lack of college education/college degree. Although I have not finished college, it is something that I
  would still like to accomplish in the future</p2>
